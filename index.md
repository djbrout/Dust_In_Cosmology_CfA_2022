# The Pitch
Most precision cosmologists find that at some point they must become experts in the cosmic dust that impacts their measurements. However, our understanding of cosmic dust beyond the Milky Way still leaves a lot to be desired which may limit the potential of future measurements in many/most of the most exciting areas of cosmology. Here we are attempting to connect the leading researchers on cosmic dust (many of which happen to reside at the CfA or in the surrounding New England area) with the rest of the cosmological community and facilitate practical discussions on the impact and mitigation of dustâ€™s role in cosmological inference.

We plan a two-day interactive workshop with instructive talks aimed at reaching across the aisle and to facilitate discussions in the afternoons that focus on assessing our current understanding of these physical effects and to address the following questions:
* What is our current understanding of dust in the Milky Way and does it apply beyond our own galaxy? How much does it vary from galaxy to galaxy and how much does it change over cosmic time/redshift/galaxy stellar population age?
* What is the impact of dust on the main cosmological probes of the next generation? How well must we understand dust so that residual biases do not limit cosmological constraints of future experiments?
* What impact does dust have on our understanding of dark energy, the accelerating universe, and the 'Hubble tension'? Is it a deal breaker? Or is it just a systematic?
