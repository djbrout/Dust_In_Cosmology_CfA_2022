# <a name="pitch"></a>The Pitch
Nearly all precision cosmologists must understand to what level cosmic dust that impacts their measurements. Yet, while our understanding of cosmic dust in the Milky Way and beyond has developed significantly, there remain many questions that affect the potential constraining of future measurements in many/most of the most exciting areas of cosmology. 

We are attempting to connect the leading researchers on cosmic dust with the rest of the cosmological community and facilitate instructional talks, practical discussions, and real-time collaborations on the impact and mitigation of dustâ€™s role in cosmological inference.

We are planning a 2-day in-person (Harvard Smithsonian CfA) interactive workshop aimed at bringing the dust and cosmology fields together and addressing the following questions:
* What is our current understanding of dust in the Milky Way and does it apply beyond our own galaxy? How much does it vary from galaxy to galaxy and how much does it change over cosmic time/redshift/age/stellar population?
* What impact does dust have on our understanding of dark energy, the accelerating universe, and the 'Hubble tension' today? 
* What is the impact of dust on the main cosmological probes of the next generation? How well must we understand dust so that residual biases do not limit cosmological constraints of future experiments?
